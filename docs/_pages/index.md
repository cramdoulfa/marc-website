I am a transdisciplinary researcher and technologist. 

I have carried research in academia (UC Berkeley), big tech (Facebook AI) and start-up environments (Bloom, Jalgos).

I went from building algorithms to analysing how they impact our society. I am now investigate algorithmic biases, with a focus on social media recommender systems.

[Below](index.html#in-the-news) is a selection of my works that have been featured in the media, 
including [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/02/technology/youtube-conspiracy-theory.html), 
[le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2020/03/06/videos-complotistes-youtube-a-la-capacite-de-moderer-son-contenu-lorsqu-il-en-a-la-volonte-politique_6032050_4408996.html),

## Former Projects

**An analysis of YouTube's promotion of conspiratorial content** <br>
Lead author of an [audit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03318){:target="_blank"} of YouTube's recommendation engine. 
The study was published with [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/02/technology/youtube-conspiracy-theory.html){:target="_blank"}, 
and was [cited](https://malinowski.house.gov/sites/malinowski.house.gov/files/Letter%20to%20YouTube%20--%20Malinowski_Eshoo_final_0.pdf){:target="_blank"} by US Congress in a formal letter to the CEO's of Google and YouTube. 
Interviews featured in [le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2020/03/06/videos-complotistes-youtube-a-la-capacite-de-moderer-son-contenu-lorsqu-il-en-a-la-volonte-politique_6032050_4408996.html){:target="_blank"} 
and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3csymts).<br>
The analysis relied on a monitoring infrastructure paired with a machine learning classifier to detect conspiratorial content.

**Uncovering physiognomic filter-bubbles on TikTok**
An experiment which showed how race and appearance impact recommendability on TikTok. 
Featured in [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/tiktok-algorithim-racial-bias){:target="_blank"}, 
[Vox](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/25/21152585/tiktok-recommendations-profile-look-alike){:target="_blank"}, 
[Wired UK](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/tiktok-filter-bubbles){:target="_blank"}, 
[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2020/04/14/does-tiktok-have-a-race-problem/#236b246a3260){:target="_blank"}... 

**AlgoTransparency**
[AlgoTransparency](https://algotransparency.org/){:target="_blank"} is aimed at monitoring the channels most promoted by YouTube's recommendation engine to logged-out users.

**Investigating Sniper Ad Targeting**
A [master thesis](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2019/sniper-ad-targeting){:target="_blank"} project investigating whether and how an malign ads can be tailored and sent to a single individual. 
Advised by Professor [Deirdre Mulligan](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/deirdre-mulligan){:target="_blank"}. Introductory video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKdFlBHqhjI){:target="_blank"}.

**Auditing a Judicial Algorithm**
In depth-analysis of a Pretrial Risk-Assessment Tool used in the U.S to determine whether a defendant should be placed in detention before their trial. Research [presented](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/philosophy/our-recent-past-talks/) at the Information Ethics Roundtable at Northeastern University.

**Cybersecurity Consulting**
Consulting within the [Citizen Clinic](https://cltc.berkeley.edu/about-us/citizen-clinic/){:target="_blank"} 
for a civil-rights NGO from central-America, to help them defend against cyber-threats and state-surveillance.
